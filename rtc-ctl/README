rtc-ctl supports the calibration and use of DS1302 RTCs on the RPi.

At this writing, boards with the DS1302 are available for about $2 USD,
including battery. They interface to the RPi via 3 GPIO pins, which can
be selected for local convenience (and to avoid other projects).

Some of these boards include pull-up resistors on the I/O lines.  These
must be removed.  The DS1302 has internal pull-downs; pull-ups can cause
data corruption.

No kernel driver is required when the GPIO pins are directly accessed.
This is known to work with the BCM2835, and NOT with the BCM2711.

When libgpiod V2 is available, the kernel gpio driver is used.  This
is required for newer RPi (and should support any board). Note:
libgpiod V1 has an incompatible API.  V2 is not currently packaged.
To install in /usr/local (requires kernel 4.6 (4.8? with CONFIG_GPIOLIB).:
 apt-get install autoconf autoconf-archive libtool git git-gui
 git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git libgpiod
 autoupdate
 ./autogen.sh --enable-tools=yes --prefix=/usr/local
 cd libgpiod; make && make install
The rtc-ctl Makefile will detect a V2 installation and use it.
The selected I/O pins need not be on the same "Chip", but must have unique
names.  To use non-default GPIO pins, see the Makefile.

This program provides access to all of the chips features, including
settng the TOY's time manually or from system time, setting system
time from the TOY, accessing the battery backed-up RAM and other
functions.  Note that although the user interface is run in local
time, the chip is operated using UTC.

After installing the clock, the --test-ram command is a recommended
to verify the interface & chip.  Note that --test-ram does not preserve
existing meory contents.  If successful, the ram is cleared.

Compatible with "hwclock" commands for easy replacment in system
scripts.

With calibration, very good accuracy can be attained, as shown here:

The TOY includes a trickle charger for supercapacitors and some
rechargeable batteries.  Study the hardware documentation before
enabling it.  The charger is NOT suitable for battery types that
require temperature monitoring, including NiCADs.  See the Maxim
application notes.  Do not enable the charger without adequate
hardware knowledge.  Misapplication can cause catastrophic failures.

The associated Makefile will install this program on the standard
Debian (Raspbian) distribution so that it runs at startup and shutdown,
with hourly syncs to system time.

The TOYeval.xls spreadsheet is provided to help with tracking drift.
Directions for its user are in the spreadsheet.

NTP, while not required, is highly recommended to provide a reference for
calibration.

rtc-ctl --help provides additional information.
