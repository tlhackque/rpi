rtc-ctl supports the calibration and use of DS1302 RTCs on the RPi.

At this writing, boards with the DS1302 are available for about $2 USD,
including battery. They interface to the RPi via 3 GPIO pins, which can
be selected for local convenience (and to avoid other projects).

No kernel driver is required.

This program provides access to all of the chips features, including
settng the TOY's time manually or from system time, setting system
time from the TOY, accessing the battery backed-up RAM and other
functions.  Note that although the user interface is run in local
time, the chip is operated using UTC.  

Compatible with "hwclock" commands for easy replacment in system
scripts.

With calibration, very good accuracy can be attained, as shown here:

The TOY includes a trickle charger for supercapacitors and some
rechargeable batteries.  Study the hardware documentation before
enabling it.  The charger is NOT suitable for battery types that
require temperature monitoring, including NiCADs.  See the Maxim
application notes.  Do not enable the charger without adequate
hardware knowledge.  Misapplication can cause catastrophic failures.

The associated Makefile will install this program on the standard
Debian (Raspbian) distribution so that it runs at startup and shutdown,
with hourly syncs to system time.

The TOYeval.xls spreadsheet is provided to help with tracking drift.
Directions for its user are in the spreadsheet.

NTP, while not required, is highly recommended to provide a reference for
calibration.

rtc-ctl --help provides additional information.
